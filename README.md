Morality as a subject has implications to a lot of other subjects and can be used to explain real world phenomena. The theory of Moral Foundations (MFT), which divides morality into five pillars: care, fairness, loyalty, sanctity, and authority, allows us to explain the rhetoric of any speaker through morality.

Connecting morality to the realm of politics allows social scientists to explore and explain how political officials think. In an election year, I thought it would be insightful to look into presidential rhetoric, especially presidential candidate debates. In the past few election cycles, the popularity of presidential debates has grown exponentially. Especially in the age of mass media, the importance of these debates has also grown significantly with viewers' ideals being subject to change based on how candidates talk about themes and ideas brought up during these debates. Analyzing debates through the lens of the MFT allows trends and patterns to be drawn amongst presidential candidates.

My primary source of data came from The Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) on debates.org which contains another extensive library of presidential speeches dating back to 1960. The CPD contains transcripts for both presidential and vice-presidential debates.

After identifying this general source of data, I then had to scrape the data from each of the webpages as well as make the data suitable for analysis. To do this I use a number of python libraries for browser automation and web scraping. First I had to identify the home pages on which links to each debate transcript are located. After I had this initial link, I had a starting point to then scrape each link. Using Beautiful Soup, a python library that is used to pull data out of XML and HTML files, I was able to build an array of debate links. Using this method I was able to make a list of 56 links or essentially 50 transcripts. After this, I used the Selenium library to pull text from each of the 56 links. Finally, I downloaded these transcripts as .txt files and now I have a working corpus of texts to analyze. Although I didn't use all of these in my final project. They proved useful as I already had the 6 sets of presidential scores as well as the option to go into more presidents in the future.
